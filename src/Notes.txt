CI/CD : continuous integration / continuous development(delivery)
All of the software that we use whether it is a website or app or any operating system, they are in continuous state of change.
We need to continuously develop and update these softwares, so that the customer can use the latest features.
Jenkins is one such software that will help us automate this process.
1/ once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer pushes that code to the development server. He
    verifies the changes and runs a few test cases to make sure all works fine. (test on our local machine might pass but not pass on server.
 2/ Once all looks good, QA will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need to take approvals from team leads or managers.
 3/ once all looks good on QA, take approval from head of team and write an email again to deploy all the changes to staging server.
 4/ once all look good on staging, do the same for the production.
